# About

Hi Github viewers, welcome to my profile. 
This is where I am capturing my attempts to keep up with new software technologies or whatever sparks my interest.
I am doing this in the spare time remaining after a full time senior software engineering leadership job and my commitments to my family.
My repositories below should give you an idea of the various things I am learning.

Cheers!
